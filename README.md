# Circle Challenge

This lab introduced us to Python classes. Specifically, how to correctly define instance variables, class methods, and class variables when creating a custom class definition, as well as how to instantiate a class object and properly access its variables and methods. The lab accomplished this by first having us define a Circle class, in which, the radius had to be stored as an instance variable, and various methods had to be defined to find and return the diameter, circumference, and area of the Circle. It also included methods to grow the circle by multiplying the radius times 2, as well as return the radius. The second part of the lab had us get and validate input from the user for the initial radius value to be passed into the class constructor as the instance's radius. Finally, we had to ask the user if they would like to grow their circle and do so, or not, based on the response.

The most difficult part of this lab was the extended challenge, which required us to create a Validator class to house our unit tests in. The Validator class, when instantiated, checks and validates all of the data contained in an instance of a circle. I was unable to get this correct on my first attempt.
